For this version of Conenct 4 I used a Monte Carlo Search Tree Technique to play.

I searched up a few different approaches to the algorithm and played with a different number of iterations to train my model.

I trained my model playing against a random agent.

When training on just 8 iterations I foudn that I was able to beat a random agent 80 percent of the time.

When upticking the number of iterations of 100 I was able to beat a random agent 92 percent of the time. 

I also found that it became much smarter. Previously it would always choose the left most column and if the opponent 
blocked then it would choose the right most column.
After training just 100 times it was able to learn better moves, like be more central and try to make different types of winning moves.
