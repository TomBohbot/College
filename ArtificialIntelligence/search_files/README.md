# Analysis on Different Heuristics:

I can see that the better the heuristic the better the algorithm will run. This was very interesting to see as
 keeping the same algorithm but tweaking the heuristic can drastically improve the performance. This was interesting
 to see because we are taught to constantly improve the Big-Oh but not as much about improving constant time operations.
 
In Search Part 1 and Search Part 2 Unifrom heuristic the algorithm was not even able to run on a 4x4 board and the performance drop 
can be seen when going from a 2x2 to 3x3 board. The more sophisticated heursitcs performed quite well, especially the Manhattan Distance.

Heuristic 1 was still not able to run 100 simulations of a 4x4 board in a timely manner while the Manhattan Distance heursitc was which was very interesting.

In fact the Manhattan Distance was only slightly more costly on a 4x4 board than an uniform heurisitic on a 3x3 board which truly shows how much a heuristic can impact an algorithm.
