Section 2: Ordering Running Times

1. n^2 

2. n^3 

3. 100n^2 

4. n log n

5. 2^n   

How much slower (in terms of a "factor relative to the previous input size") do
each of these algorithms get when you double the input size?

1)
2)
3)
4)
5)X (square of previous running time, I don't think that's what you're saying)

each of these algorithms get when you increase the input size by 1?

Section 3:  Really Understanding Order-of-Growth

Suppose you have a computer that can perform 10^10 operations per second, and
you need to compute a result in at most an hour of computation. For each of the
algorithms, what is the largest input size n for which you would be able to get
the result within an hour

1. n^2 

2. n^3 

3. 100n^2 

4. n log n

5. 2^n 

6. 2^{2n}
