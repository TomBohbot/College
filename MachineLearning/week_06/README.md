- Assignment 1a: Iris_Decision_Tree.ipynb and iris_decision_tree.py and decision_tree.png
  - Create decision tree using sklearn and save in a png file names decision_tree.
- Assignment 1b: Voting_Ensemble.ipynb and voting_ensemble.py
  - Take your best Log. Regression code, knn code, and decision tree and create a voting ensemble classifier
- Assignment 1c: Iris_Random_Forest.ipynb and voting_ensemble.py
  - Create a random forest classifier.
  - To accurately compare to ensembler and dec_tree and look at the ensempler .pynb file and dec_tree .pynb file for most accurate response.
- Assignment 1d: Iris_Dataset_AdaBoost_And_XGBoost.ipynb and iris_dataset_adaboost_and_xgboost.py
  - Create a gradient boosted classifier using AdaBoost
- Optional code for clarity: IrisKnn.ipynb and irisknn.py
  - The ensmbler asked for a new knn algorithm which I pushed to git in its own file for more code readability
